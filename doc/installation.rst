Installation
============

**Bioconvert** is developed in Python so you can use the **pip** method to install it easily. We recommend to use a
virtual environment to not interfere with your system. In any case, install **BioConvert** with::

    pip install bioconvert

Note, however, that you will be able to use only about half of the conversions (pure Python). Others depend 
on third-party software.

One solution is to create a dedicated environment using **conda**. In particular, we use `bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io>`_ to install those dependencies.

conda / bioconda /mamba installation
--------------------------------------

One workable and relatively straightfoward installation is based on conda/mamba::


    conda create --name bioconvert python=3.8
    conda activate bioconvert
    conda install mamba

Then, use mamba to install the missing executable. Dependencies and **BioConvert** are available on the **bioconda**
channel (see more about channels at the bottom of the page). For example for **samtools**::

    mamba install samtools -c bioconda

Third-package executables can be installed with your own method. We recommend and provide solutions for **conda**.
Indeed, **BioConvert** is available on the `bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io>`_ channel (see :ref:`conda_channels` section for details).

So, you could create a conda environment and install **bioconvert** directly with all dependencies. This is, however, pretty slow due to the large
number of dependencies::

    conda create --name bioconvert bioconvert

Instead, we recommend to use an intermediate tool called **mamba** that will provide a more robust and faster
installation::

    conda create -c bioconda --name bioconvert mamba
    conda activate bioconvert
    mamba install bioconvert -c bioconda

In Jan 2023, this method worked out of box and created an environment with Python3.10 and bioconvert 0.6.2 with all its
dependencies.

We also provide a frozen version of an environment with the bioconvert github repository. Note, however, that this file
may change with time. This will create a conda environment called bioconvert. See the link 

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioconvert/bioconvert/main/environment.yml -O test.yml
    conda create install create -f test.yml

Docker
------

A Dockerfile (version 0.6.1 of **BioConvert**) is available on dockerhub::

    docker pull bioconvert/bioconvert:0.6.1

Which can be used as follows::

    docker run bioconvert -d /home/user:/home/user bioconvert /home/user/test_file.fastq /home/user/test_file.fasta

Since **bioconvert** is on bioconda, it is also available on quay.io. For instance, version 0.6.2 is reachable here::

    docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/bioconvert:0.6.2--pyhdfd78af_0

Singularity/Apptainer
----------------------

We provide Singularity/Apptainer images of **BioConvert** within the https://damona.readthedocs.io project.

The version 0.6.2 of **BioConvert** is available for downloads.

Using damona::

    pip install damona

    # create and activate an environment
    damona env --create test_bioconvert
    damona activate test_bioconvert
    damona install bioconvert
    bioconvert

You can also install the singularity image yourself by downloading it::

    wget https://zenodo.org/record/7034822/files/bioconvert_0.6.1.img
    singularity exec bioconvert_0.6.1.img bioconvert

    # you can also create an alias
    alias bioconvert="singularity run bioconvert.simg bioconvert"

.. warning:: You will need singularity of course. If you have a conda environment, you are lucky. singularity is there/ 

.. _conda_channels:

Conda channels
--------------

First, you will need to set up the **bioconda** channel if not already done::

    conda config --add channels defaults
    conda config --add channels bioconda
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict

.. warning:: it is important to add them in this order, as mentionned on bioconda webpage    (https://bioconda.github.io/).

If you have already set the channels, please check that the order is correct.
With the following command::

    conda config --get channels

You should see::

    --add channels 'defaults'
    --add channels 'bioconda'
    --add channels 'conda-forge'# highest priority
