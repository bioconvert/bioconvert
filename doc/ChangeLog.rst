:Revision 0.3.0: April/May 2019

    - refactoring of the core including the implementation of an implicit
      conversion. So, we can use bioconvert without specifying the conversion
      when there is no ambiguity (based on the extensions provided).
    - New working version for pypi.
    - new converters: wig2bed
    - new methods in various converters related to  phylogeny
    - Fixing the goalign and gotree scripts 
    - Fixing all tests on Travis

:Revision 0.2.0: 7 Aug 2018

    - remove pandoc from requirements. The version installed is the one from
      conda. However, conda version is a standalone only, not the code source
      so, using it in the requirements causes trouble on bioconda when building
      bioconvert. We do not use pandoc in the code for now, so let us remove it.
    - added tests for gff22gff3; moved test data sets related to GFF2 and GFF3.

:Revision 0.1.3: 2nd Aug 2018

    - add abi2fastq
    - add abi2fasta
    - add script called bioconvert_stats
    - refactorise scf2fasta and sc2fastq putting common code in utils.scf
    - update go version in requirements + update of modules using go

:Revision 0.1.1:

    - add phylip2xmfa and xmfa2phylip,
    - add bedgraph2bed
    - Fixed #132 (bedgraph2bigwig can now have chrom sizes as input)
    - add bam2wiggle, bed2wiggle, bcf2wiggle, vcf2wiggle etc

:Revision 0.1.0: 3 April 2018

    Major refactoring to allow sub commands to be used::

        bioconvert fastq2fasta test.fastq test.fasta

    instead of::

        bioconvert test.fastq test.fasta

    as well as transitive conversion: if a conversion is not implemented but
    a path exists, then conversion can be performed using -a option::

        bioconvert A2C test.A test.C -a

    - new converters: maf2sam, ods2csv, xls2csv, xlsx2csv


:Revision 0.0.12:
